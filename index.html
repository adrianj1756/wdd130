        <p>Hello! My name is Adrian Jimenez. I am from Southern California but am living in Provo,Utah with my wife
            Andrea and our dog Atlas. I love to play video games and watch movies. One of my favorite video game series
            is the Legend of Zelda and my favorite movies are superhero ones like Marvel and DC. I also like to read
            comic books and am just a huge nerd.</p>

        <p>Utah is a State located in the western United States. It has beautiful landscape like the orange desert rocks
            as shown here in southern Utah and has georgeous mountains, lakes, and trees throughout the rest of the
            state. Something I love is that we get all 4 seasons here and they are all beautiful.</p>
